It features an editable database of songs, protected with user log-in and authentication, as well as "Media Mode" -- an interface for projecting lyrics during live band play. 

## Technologies: 

Songbook is built with React/Next.js, using Tailwind CSS, hosted on Vercel with a MongoDB database for storage. User log-in and authentication is through Clerk.
